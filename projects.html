        <h3>Gym Journal</h3>
        <p>Gym Journal is an intelligent workout tracker. The user inputs their exercises and the app will do the rest! The app uses a hamburger menu for navigation and I am currently working on user input of their exercises which will be stored in a Realm database. The next set of features I will tackle are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Useful graphs such as overall volume over time and specific exercise volume over time.</li>
            <li>Personal record tracking.</li>
            <li>Informing users of muscles or body parts that they haven’t worked on in a while that may need attention.</li>
            <li>In-app purchase of some of the above features</li>
            <li>A stretch goal of implementing a server that the app can use to access a database of exercises.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I learned the development lifecycle of a mobile app from industry experts in the Software Development for Mobile Devices class. I worked as a part of a group to develop <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/amalgamate/id1103942963?mt=8" target="_blank">Amalgamate</a>, a social media aggregator, it’s on the Apple App Store! Our group took an agile development approach to building our app and we adapted to problems as we encountered them. I received an 87% mark in this class.</p>

        <h3>Cloud Based Connect-4</h3>
        <p>In Mobile and Cloud Computing, I worked as part of a group to develop a cloud based Connect-4 game. The server was written in C# and could connect clients on the platforms iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows. I received an 85% mark in this class.</p>
