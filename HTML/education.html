        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a Bachelor of Science Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan.  During the later years of my computer science degree I have been taking classes that focus on mobile development and group work. This will benefit my future employer and I in a mobile development position.  Check out some of the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I worked on in my classes!</p>
