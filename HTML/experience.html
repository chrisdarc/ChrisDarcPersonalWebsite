        <h2>Industry Work Experience</h2>
        <h3><a href="http://www.pushinteractions.com" target="_blank">Push Interactions</a></h3>
        <p>Worked for four months full time as an iOS Developer Intern as a part of an Agile development team to develop Apps in Objective C and Swift. This position allowed me to learn the intricacies of working as a part of a professional development team. Some examples of team actions I participated in to build value for the company:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pair programming at the beginning of projects, or to solve difficult problems.</li>
            <li>Numerous code reviews to help ensure the company was producing quality code.</li>
            <li>Attended team meetings to discuss new approaches to programming to improve our overall codebase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I became a trusted resource in the company, enough that I was asked to help interview potential candidates for iOS Development and give my recommendations to the COO.</p>
        <p>I added value to the company by promptly delivering well written code. Some of the apps I contributed to that are on the Apple App Store:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Converted the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/skill-shark-athlete-evaluations/id988596045?mt=8" target="_blank">SkillShark</a> app from supporting iPad only to supporting both iPad and iPhone in only 5 days.</li>
            <li>Found and solved several difficult bugs in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/apl-app-pro-logistics/id1078015849?mt=8" target="_blank">App-Pro Logistics</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/skill-shark-athlete-evaluations/id988596045?mt=8" target="_blank">SkillShark</a>.</li>
            <li>Helped reach a time deadline with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/snap-smart-nutritional-advice/id1139428979?mt=8" target="_blank">SNAP: Smart Nutritional Advice for Pets</a> app by implementing some of the final features as well as solving a few bugs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I developed apps using the following technology:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used Git for version control and have a good understanding of how it works.</li>
            <li>Managed dependencies with <a href="https://cocoapods.org/" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a>, experience working with numerous 3rd party libraries.</li>
            <li>Used Apple’s CoreBluetooth Framework to communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.</li>
            <li>Implemented In-App Purchase in Swift on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/rez-monsters/id1115830312?mt=8" target="_blank">Rez Monsters</a> project.</li>

            <li>Stored data within many apps using <a href="https://realm.io/products/realm-mobile-database/" target="_blank">Realm</a> databases.</li>
            <li>Used the App Coordinator approach in building some apps to remove code from the View Controller.</li>
            <li>Improved my ability to abstract problems and solve them by fixing bugs in numerous apps.</li>
        </ul>
