        <h2>Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Vancouver, graduated from <a href="http://www.collingwood.org" target="_blank">high school</a>, and then moved to Saskatoon to attend the <a href="http://www.usask.ca" target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a>.
            <a href="toby.jpg" target="_blank">Toby</a> is my dog, he is twelve years old but still plays like a puppy.
            I spend my spare time with <a href="family.JPG" target="_blank">family</a> (photo is missing my sister <a href="Larissa.JPG" target="_blank">Larissa</a>, she's very busy), <a href="photoWithNicole.JPG" target="_blank">girlfriend</a>, and <a href="boatboys.jpg" target="_blank">friends</a> (don't worry I have more than three), working on personal programming <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">projects</a>, exercising, and dreaming about the <a href="alpina.jpg" target="_blank">car</a><a href="escalade.jpg" target="_blank"> (s)</a> I want to own someday.
            I occasionally post pictures on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisdarc/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, request to follow me if you are interested.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entourage_(U.S._TV_series)" target="_blank">Entourage</a> is one of my favourite TV shows, too bad it's over.
            I enjoy trying new food, but not seafood, unless it is salmon.  If I had to eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be a burger, different every day, hopefully I wouldn't get too fat.
            You can usually find me at my parent's cabin on <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Salt+Spring+Island,+BC/@48.8291412,-123.5521033,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x548f5a19626d9787:0xf132d8e48ca8c55b!8m2!3d48.8166622!4d-123.5088755?hl=en" target="_blank">Salt Spring Island</a>

            I am into <a href="NightAtTheMiddle.jpg" target="_blank">photography</a> but I haven't had a chance to take many pictures lately. If you are wondering I use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D200" target="_blank">Nikon D200</a> and I took most of the photos that this page links to. I have a couple different lenses but we won't get into that.

        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>I don't know too much about HTML or CSS but I wanted a personal website, so I got to work! I purchased the domain names chrisdarc.com and chrisdarc.ca, and some hosting space. I spent some of my spare time (there's not much of it) on the weekend of January 21 and 22 of 2017 putting this site together.  I am learning a little bit of web programming right now (see <a href="education.html" target="_blank">education</a>), but what you see here is largely self taught. I started from scratch using the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/?fromMenu" target="_blank">WebStorm IDE</a> and I will try to update the site periodically. You can follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com/chrisdarc/ChrisDarcPersonalWebsite">GitHub</a>, usually the latest changes are on the develop branch or a feature branch. Have questions? comments? criticism? found a bug? Just need someone to talk to? <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">Contact me!</a></p>
